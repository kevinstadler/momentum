## Momentum in language change: supporting material

This repository contains the supporting material for:

> Kevin Stadler, Richard A. Blythe, Kenny Smith, Simon Kirby (2017) "Momentum in language change: a model of self-actuating s-shaped curves". *Language Dynamics and Change 6(2)* p.171-198 (doi:[10.1163/22105832-00602005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22105832-00602005))

### R code to create the figures and the analytical approximation

See [figures.pdf](R/figures.pdf) in the [R](R/) folder

### Simulation code

The simulation code found in [src](src/) is written in Clojure and can be run on any JVM. The easiest way to run it is by installing [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation) and then executing

    lein run 1

in the root directory (containing the project.clj file)
